class Parameters:
    # We want a model with a low cost. The solver will search this range for the lowest cost
    #   it can find. It will quit once the difference between the lowest satisfiable (sat)
    #   solution and the highest unsatisfiable/timeout (unsat/unknown) is less than the
    #   resolution.
    cost_hi: int = 17227064385339908 # Reachable upper bound for standard H
    # cost_hi: int =   10000000000000000 # Upper bound for G_24
    # cost_hi: int =   3000000000000000 # Upper bound for G_16 and G_12
    cost_lo: int =  1
    cost_res: int = 1
    # -Easy SAT and clearly UNSAT problems are solved quickly.
    # -The solver learns more from solving SAT problems.
    #   Therefore search begins at cost_hi and decreases each time by initial_hi_to_lo_ratio_step_up.
    #   Once the first UNSAT or UNKNOWN is encountered, after_failure_step_up_ratio is used instead.
